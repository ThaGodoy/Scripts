# ScriptsSequencing

## Identification of polymorphisms in the chicken chromosome 2 region associated with muscle deposition
> The aim of this study was to perform the genome
resequencing of 18 chicken from two distinct experimental lines and identify SNPs and
INDELs in a QTL region on chromosome 2 previously associated with breast muscle, and
characterize the variants to identify potentially function ones and propose candidate mutations
for future studies.

## Status
Project is: _finished_
