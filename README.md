### Sequencing
#### Identification of polymorphisms in the chicken chromosome 2 region associated with muscle deposition
> The aim of this study was to perform the genome
resequencing of 18 chicken from two distinct experimental lines and identify SNPs and
INDELs in a QTL region on chromosome 2 previously associated with breast muscle, and
characterize the variants to identify potentially function ones and propose candidate mutations
for future studies.

#### Status
Project is: _finished_

### Genotyping
#### Inherited copy number variation in the chicken genome and association with breast muscle traits
> To identify, characterize and validate CNVs in the genome of two experimental
populations of chickens from Embrapa Swine and Poultry National Research Centre. And
perform a genome-wide association study of CN state with quantitative breast muscle traits.

#### Status
Project is: _finished_
